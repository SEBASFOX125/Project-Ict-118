🧩Challenges Faced and Solutions
1. Photo Carousel (Bootstrap)
Challenge: Understanding how Bootstrap's carousel classes and structure work
Solution: Studied Bootstrap Carousel documentation, watched YouTube tutorials, and dissected example code until I understood the use of .carousel, .carousel-inner, .carousel-item, and how JavaScript transitions apply.

2. Sticky Navbar Positioning
Challenge: Navbar was not staying fixed at the top as expected
Solution: Learned the difference between position: fixed and position: sticky. Applied top: 0 and ensured parent containers didn’t have overflow issues. Used developer tools to debug element behavior.

3. JavaScript Date and Time Display
Challenge: Couldn't properly render current date and time in the footer
Solution: Referenced JavaScript Date() object, practiced using setInterval() to update the clock every second, and dynamically inserted the output into the DOM.

4. Layout Breaking on Mobile Devices
Challenge: Sections overlapping on smaller screens
Solution: Used media queries and Bootstrap’s grid system. Tested responsiveness using browser dev tools and fixed layout issues by adding col-sm, col-md classes and removing fixed widths.
